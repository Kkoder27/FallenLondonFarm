# WELCOME, DELICIOUS FRIEND!
#This is a Fallen London AutoFarmer Designed by Kkoder27 for use in some of the more tedious, cyclical FL grinds
# 
#Read this file carefully to understand how to use and apply these files
#
#
#
#
#First, your username and password need to be properly made and added to the .gitignore folder for two purposes
# 1: keeping things in the .gitignore folder will ensure your personal login credentials are kept secure if updates are made. 
#   The .gitignore folder is not updated or affected when updates are pulled from github
#
# 2: we gotta keep your info somewhere so the script can access your account to actually do its thing. .gitignore is an easy, relatively secure
#   place to hold that information
#
# With All that in mind, run the makeconfig.py script to initiate the process that will make your configuration file within the .gitignore folder.
#
# After this, move your FL character to either:
#   Moloch Street (The Sunken Embassy)
#   Spite (The Underclay)
#   The University (Hunting Bees in Old Newgate)
#   The Blind Helmsmen (L.B. Industries)
#   The Singing Mandrake (The Spider Symposium)
#
#Currently, only the 5 Great Sink Grinds are supported, though if interest is had, more will be added. 
# 
# Once there, the script will analyze which options are mathmatically optimal for income based on your current attributes
# or will farm for skill increase based on your input.
